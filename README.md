### Hi, I'm Carla! 👩🏻‍💻

Never it’s too late to start a new adventure! That’s why I decided to begin a new career as **Frontend Developer** after 7 years working for different companies as Project Manager. It is a new environment where I want to challenge myself and keep learning every single day from talented and highly experienced people.

- 🚀 Currently graduate as a **MERN Stack developer** on [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en) 
- 💻  Working with `JavaScript`, `ReactJS`, `NodeJS` and `MongoDB`
- 📚  Latest project: [FavTime](https://github.com/CarlaNavia/Favour_Time.client)
- 🎯 My motto is “To keep learning every single day”  
- 📩  Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlanavia/) or by [e-mail](mailto:cnavia27@gmail.com) 
- 🥂  A bit more about me: I love to practice yoga and to eat “croquetas”
